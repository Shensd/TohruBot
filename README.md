# Tohru Bot

![Banner](./res/img/banner.png)

Another Discord Music Bot

Tohru bot is the onlyâ„¢ Discord bot (not really) that plays music from Youtube, either through given links or search queries.

## How do I add it?

Tohru is not yet ready to be added to servers, but this repository can be pulled and ran locally, simply rename `/res/auth/example_auth.json` to `/res/auth/auth.json` and replace the given entry with your bot token.

Tohru runs off of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and it will need to be installed on the running system.

Once node is installed the bot can then be ran with `node bot.js`

## Documentation

Admin commands require the user to have the `Bot Commander` role, this role requires no extra permissions the name is the only important part.
